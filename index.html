<p>In this project we created a 3 dimensional maze game for you to enjoy. The game generates random mazes, in whatever sizes you'd like for you to enjoy and try solving. Tired of solving? The project also includes a built-in Solving Server, That will hint you in the right direction or show you the way.</p>

<p>Poor Duke lost his nose, and the only way to bring it back to him is by solving this difficult, yet fun, maze.

<p>This project was built as a part of Algorithms in Java course in the College of Management with Nissim Brami. It has both Client and Server sides, both working with a completely separated MVP design, and communicating via TCP Sockets. The project includes various design patterns, such as Observer Pattern, Strategy pattern, Adapter Pattern. 
We implemented a solving Server using BFS (Best First Search) and A* algorithms. </p>
